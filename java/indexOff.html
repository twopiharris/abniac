<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
</center>
Because of the nature of the web, it is not possible to know how this
program will work on every machine and browser.  You must have a Java
1.02 capable browser to use Java ABNIAC.  Netscape 3.0 and greater,
and MS Internet explorer 3.0 and greater have this capability.
<br>
<br>
In general, if ABNIAC acts strangely, close down your browser
completely, then come back to the ABNIAC page again.  
<br>
<br>
We have had problems with the menus disappearing and with email
occasionally not working.  Check with your instructor if you have problems.
<br><br>
On the bottom of this page, you will see some audio - video links.  If
you have the realplayer plug in (available for free from 
<a href = http://www.real.com>real.com</a>) 
you can see videos explaining exactly how to use abniac to learn about
        how computers work.
